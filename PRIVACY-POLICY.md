# Privacy Policy for Duplicate Identifier

**Effective Date: 8/21/2023**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Duplicate Identifier. We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the personal information that is collected, used, and shared when users utilize our Google Sheets add-on.

## 2. What Information Do We Collect?

Duplicate Identifier operates entirely within the Google Sheets environment and doesnâ€™t collect, store, or transmit your data outside of this environment. Specifically, it does not:

- Store any personal data outside the active Google Sheet.
- Transmit any personal data to external servers or third-party entities.
- Access data from other Google services or products.

The sole function of the add-on is to identify and process duplicate entries within your Google Sheets based on your input. Any data processing takes place within your instance of Google Sheets and is not accessed or stored by us.

## 3. How Do We Use The Information?

The data processed by Duplicate Identifier is used exclusively for the purpose of identifying and processing duplicates within your Google Sheet. No data is retained after the processing is completed.

## 4. Data Security

Your data security is paramount to us. Since Duplicate Identifier operates exclusively within Google Sheets and does not transmit, store, or share your data, the inherent security of Google Sheets protects your data.

## 5. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page, and users are encouraged to review our Privacy Policy periodically.

## 6. Your Rights

You have the right to access personal information we might hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. Since Duplicate Identifier does not collect or store personal information outside of Google Sheets, no external data access is possible. You maintain control of your data within Google Sheets at all times.
